I have included feature tables with matching samples from our decomposition soil along with their important metadata.

16S_ASV_table feature table are 16S ASV non-rarefied abundances
18S_ASV_table feature table are 18S ASV non-rarefied abundances
MAG_bact_table feature table are metagenome-assembled genome abundances. 
MAG_bact_genes_table feature table are metagenome-assembled gene abundances. 
MAG_bact_gene_modules_table feature table are metagenome-assembled genes collapsed by metabolic modules abundances. 
metabolite_formula_predictions_table feature table are metabolite abundances in which we were able to confidently predict a formula.

In the metadata, I have provided the host ID, add_0c (our time variable), add_0c_group (decomposition stage), and the facility the samples came from (geographic location).
